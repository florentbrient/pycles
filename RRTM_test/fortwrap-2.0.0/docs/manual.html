  <h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>FortWrap is a Python script that parses Fortran 90/95/200X source
  files and generates wrapper code for interfacing with the original
  Fortran code from C++.  FortWrap is intended to be used with Fortran
  code that takes an object oriented approach and makes use of Fortran
  derived types.  The resulting wrapper code provides a C++ interface
  that wraps the Fortran derived types with C++ proxy classes.</p>

  <p>For example, consider the following Fortran code:</p>

  <div class="code"> <pre>
MODULE m

  TYPE Object
    ... 
  END TYPE Object

CONTAINS
    
  SUBROUTINE object_ctor(o, n, x)
    TYPE (Object) :: o
    INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: n
    REAL, INTENT(in) :: x(n)
    ...
  END SUBROUTINE object_ctor

  SUBROUTINE process(o)
    TYPE (Object) :: o
    ...
  END SUBROUTINE process
  
END MODULE m
  </pre></div>      

  <p>After wrapping with FortWrap, these routines can be utilized in a
  natural way from C++:</p>

  <div class="targetlang"> <pre>
std::vector&lt;float&gt; x(10);
... // Define values for x
Object o(&x); // Automatically calls object_ctor
o.process();
  </pre></div>

</ul>

<h2><a name="Unsupported">Unsupported Features</a></h2>

<p>Many features of Fortran 90/95/2003 are not supported by FortWrap.  In
some cases (e.g. assumed shape arrays) this is because the Fortran
language standard does not provide an interoperability mechanism.  In
other cases, this is because there was not a need for certain features
  when the original version of FortWrap was being developed.</p>

<p>In most situations, it is possible to get FortWrap to wrap these
types of routines by providing a Fortran wrapper that is interoperable
and calls the target routine.</p>

<p>The following argument types/constructs/features are not
supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt>ALLOCATABLE</tt> or <tt>POINTER</tt> arguments</li>

  <li> Assumed shape arrays (a declaration that looks like <tt>INTEGER
      :: X(:)</tt>).  The Fortran standard does not provide an
      interoperability mechanism for assumed shape arrays.</li>

  <li> Strings with <tt>INTENT(INOUT)</tt>.  Arrays of strings</li>

  <li> Arrays of a derived type.  These can be wrapped by creating a
    new derived type to contain an array of the derived type of
    interest.  Create an "append" function in Fortran that accepts
    only scalars but allows you to add items to the array container
    one at a time.</li>

  <li> Fortran functions with non-primitive return types are not
    wrapped.</li>

  <li><tt>COMPLEX</tt> data type is not supported</li>
</ul>

  <p>Note that FortWrap can still wrap procedures that use unsupported
    arguments if those arguments are optional.  In these cases, the
    offending arguments are hidden from the generated interface
    code.</p>



<h2><a name="GetStarted">Getting Started</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>See <tt>README.txt</tt></li>
  <li>Run "<tt>fortwrap.py -h</tt>" for usage information</li>
  <li>Look in the tests directory at examples</li>
  <li>See <a href="#Walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> below</li>
</ul>

  <p>Any one or more of three mechanisms can be used to specify the
    Fortran source file(s) to be wrapped:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Name the files on the command line using full or relative paths</li>
    <li>The <tt>-g</tt> option will wrap all <tt>.f90</tt>
      and <tt>.F90</tt> source files found in the current working
      directory.</li>
    <li>Use the <tt>--file-list</tt> option to name a file that
      contains a list of source files to be wrapped.  The format of this
      file is a newline-separated list of files to be wrapped.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Notes about the Fortran compiler</h3>

  <p>FortWrap only supports name mangling for g95 and gfortran.  If
    using the Makefile <tt>tests/Tests.mk</tt>, edit <tt>FC</tt> to
    specify your Fortran compiler.  When running FortWrap, use
    the <tt>-c</tt> option to specify the name mangling you want.
    Currently the default wrapping is for gfortran, but this can be changed
    by editing the <tt>compiler = 'gfortran'</tt> line near the beginning
    of <tt>fortwrap.py</tt></p>


  <h2><a name="Walkthrough">Walkthrough</a></h2>

  <p>Change directory to <tt>tests/derived_types</tt>.  The first step
    is to run FortWrap to generate wrapper code from the Fortran
    source code.  In this case the code to be wrapped
    is <tt>DerivedTypes.f90</tt>.  Use the following command to run
    FortWrap ("<tt>[derived_types]$</tt>" will represent the command
    prompt):</p>

  <div class="code"><pre>
[derived_types]$ ../../fortwrap.py -c gfortran -g -d wrap
  </pre></div>

  <p>This should not produce any output on the command line, which
    means that FortWrap thinks it found something to wrap and did not
    run into any problems.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <tt>-c</tt> option tells FortWrap which Fortran compiler
      will be used once you get around to compiling (running FortWrap
      does not actually compile anything).  Substitute g95 for
      gfortran if necessary.  A default Fortran compiler is specified near
      the beginning of <tt>fortwrap.py</tt>, via the line <tt>compiler
      = 'gfortran'</tt>; feel free to change this.</li>
    <li>The <tt>-g</tt> option stands for "glob" and tells FortWrap to
      try and wrap all files in the current directory that
      match <tt>*.f90</tt> or <tt>*.F90</tt>.  This is just for
      convenience, and we could have named the file explicitly instead
      by adding "<tt>DerivedTypes.f90</tt>" to the end of the command
      line.</li>
    <li>The <tt>-d wrap</tt> option tells FortWrap to put the
      generated wrapper files in the <tt>wrap</tt> directory (which
      should already exist).  Without this option, the files will be
      generated in the working directory.</li>
  </ul>
    
  <p>After running FortWrap, you should have a set of wrapper files in
    the <tt>wrap</tt> directory:</p>

  <div class="code"><pre>
[derived_types]$ ls wrap/
CppWrappers.f90  InterfaceDefs.h  ObjectA.h    ObjectB.h
FortWrap.h       ObjectA.cpp      ObjectB.cpp
  </pre></div>

  <p>These files are explained more <a href="#Files">here</a>.  The
    main things to note are that the classes FortWrap created are
    defined in the header files <tt>ObjectA.h</tt>
    and <tt>ObjectB.h</tt> (if wrapping non-method procedures, a dummy
    class called <tt>FortFuncs</tt> is created by default).
    Also, <tt>FortWrap.h</tt> is the "catch-all" header file that you
    want to include when writing a program that uses the wrappers.</p>

  <p>The next step is to build the project by compiling the original
    Fortran file, the wrapper code, and a test program, and linking
    them all together.  The makefile <tt>tests/Tests.mk</tt> is
    provided as an example of how this might be done.  On my system,
    running <tt>make</tt> produces the following commands:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
[derived_types]$ make
g++ -I wrap   -c -o prog.o prog.cpp
gfortran -I wrap -o DerivedTypes.o -c DerivedTypes.f90
gfortran -I wrap -o wrap/CppWrappers.o -c wrap/CppWrappers.f90
g++ -I wrap   -c -o wrap/ObjectA.o wrap/ObjectA.cpp
g++ -I wrap   -c -o wrap/ObjectB.o wrap/ObjectB.cpp
gfortran -o prog prog.o DerivedTypes.o wrap/CppWrappers.o wrap/ObjectA.o wrap/ObjectB.o -lstdc++
</pre></div>

  <p>In this case Fortran is used as the linker language and the
    standard C++ library is included on the link line.  It should also
    be possible to use C++ as the linker language, in which case
    Fortran runtime libraries may need to be specified on the link
    line.</p>

  <p>For this example, the compilation produces the
    executable <tt>prog</tt>.  Running the executable should produce
    no output.  The FortWrap tests are set up to use return values to
    indicate expected behavior (0 means success).  For example:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
[derived_types]$ ./prog 
[derived_types]$ echo $?
0
</pre></div>



  <h2><a name="ConfigFile">The Configuration File</a></h2>

  <p>The <tt>-i</tt> option can be used to specify a file to read
    simple configuration directives from.  This is not required, but can
    provide more control over the generated wrapper interface, and may
    be useful when wrapping very large projects.</p>

  <p>The format of the configuration file is a simple list of
    directives separated by newlines.  The directives start with
    the <tt>%</tt> character: any line that doesn't match a directive
    is treated as a comment and ignored, so comments may be
    interspersed freely without any special prefix.  Also any
    character can be inserted before a valid directive to comment it
    out, as in "<tt>// %ignore foo</tt>"</p>

  <p>The following directives are supported:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>%ignore &lt;name&gt;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>%hide &lt;procedure&gt; &lt;argument&gt;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>%include &lt;name&gt;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>%rename &lt;old&gt; &lt;new&gt;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>%ctor &lt;regex&gt;</tt></li>
    <li><tt>%dtor &lt;regex&gt;</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Ignore directive</h3>

  <p>The ignore directive is used to prevent FortWrap from creating
    wrapper code for certain constructs.  This may be useful when
    creating a C++ API for a large Fortran project, particularly when
    some Fortran declarations must be kept public even though they are
    really not part of the API (keep in mind that FortWrap will
    respect <tt>PUBLIC</tt> and <tt>PRIVATE</tt> declarations, so
    there is no need to use the ignore directive for <tt>PRIVATE</tt>
    names.)</p>

  <p><tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> may be the identifier for either a derived
    type or a procedure.  If a derived type is ignored, the
    corresponding proxy class is not created.  If a procedure is
    ignored, it is not included in the generated wrapper code.</p>

  <h3>Hide directive</h3>

  <p>The hide directive allows specific procedure arguments to be
    hidden from the generated interface.  This is only valid if the
    specified argument of the specified procedure is optional.  All
    calls from the C++ interface treat the argument as not present.
    This directive can be useful for simplifying the generated C++
    API.</p>

  <h3>Include directive</h3>

  <p>The include directive can be used to force-include a wrapper for
    either a derived type or a procedure that is <tt>PRIVATE</tt> in the
    Fortran module.</p>

  <h3>Rename directive</h3>

  <p>The rename directive can operate on either a derived type or a
    procedure.  The name <tt>&lt;old&gt;</tt> found in the Fortran
    source is replaced by the name <tt>&lt;new&gt;</tt> in the
    generated wrapper code.</p>

  <h3>Constructor and destructor directives</h3>
  
  <p>These directives allow custom regular expressions to be used for
    determining which procedures to be treated as constructors and
    destructors.  The search will be case insensitive, and the
    Python <tt>re match</tt> method is used, meaning the regular
    expression must match the beginning of the name</p>


<h2><a name="Swig">Swig tips (or how to use with other languages)</a></h2>

  <p>One of the principal advantages of wrapping code with FortWrap is
    that the generated wrappers work well as input for Swig.  This
    makes FortWrap useful even if you don't want to work with C++.
    Just tell Swig to wrap the FortWrap-generated header files for the
    target language of your choice.</p>

  <p>Here are some tips:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make sure to use the <tt>-c++</tt> option with Swig</li>

    <li>If your target language supports it, use <tt>-keyword</tt>
      (Python supports this).  This way, even though your optional
      arguments must be passed by location in C++, they can be passed by
      keyword in the target language.</li>

    <li>Use <tt>%apply int *INPUT { const int* };</tt> to create an
      input typemap (repeat for <tt>double*</tt>).  With the default
      options, this will only catch scalars because FortWrap uses
      classes (<tt>std::vector</tt> and <tt>FortranMatrix</tt>) for
      arrays (or "<tt>[]</tt>" in the case of <tt>--no-vector</tt>).
      This is compatible with the way optional arguments are treated.
      (Note that using <tt>--no-fmat</tt> or otherwise wrapping
      higher-dimensional arrays will result in wrapping these arrays
      with basic pointers, which may interfere with this type of Swig
      typemap.)</li>

    <li>Use <tt>%apply int *OUTPUT { int* };</tt> to create an
      output typemap.  Note, however, that <tt>INTENT(OUT)</tt>
      and <tt>INTENT(INOUT)</tt> arguments are not distinguishable
      based on the C header file, so this typemap will not work when
      the input value really is used.  This is why FortWrap writes
      warnings for arguments that are not explicitly declared
      either <tt>INTENT(IN)</tt> or <tt>INTENT(OUT)</tt>.  Caution is
      also needed if using this typemap in conjunction with optional
      arguments: because of the way the typemap works, there will be
      no way to "not pass" the optional argument from the target
      language.  This limitation can be worked around by creating a
      custom typemap.</li>

    <li>Be careful with using
      Swig's <a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Library.html#Library_nn15"><tt>std_vector.i</tt></a>
      library.  This drastically increases the size of the wrapper
      code and is not compatible with keyword arguments.  I am also
      not aware of a way to use this library
      with <tt>vector&lt;&gt;*</tt> arguments that are meant to store
      outputs (which typically play a big role in the wrapper code
      that FortWrap generates, since input arguments are qualified
      by <tt>const</tt>).  You are probably better off writing your
      own typemaps to handle the <tt>const</tt> and
      non-<tt>const</tt> <tt>vector</tt> arguments.  If you would
      rather have Swig handle C-style arrays, use FortWrap
      with <tt>--no-vector</tt></li>

    <li>To wrap string outputs, you may <tt>%include
	"<a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Library.html#Library_nn14">std_string.i</a>"</tt>,
	but you will need to write an <tt>argout</tt> typemap to
      handle the string pointer as an output.</li>

    <li>There are a couple different ways to work with function
      pointers in the target language (in Python, at least).  See
      the <a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIG.html#SWIG_nn30">Swig
      documentation</a>.  The simplest is to use Swig directives to
      wrap an existing C/C++ function as a <tt>%constant</tt> that can
      be passed as an argument in the target language.  With Python,
      it is also possible to define the callback function in the
      target language; this is
      explained <a href="http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ext/callingPython.html">here</a>
      in the Python documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h3><a name="details-dt">Derived Types</a></h3>

  <p>The main goal of FortWrap is to allow users to develop C++
    interfaces to Fortran code that applies object oriented techniques
    by making use of derived types.  In order to interface with
    Fortran derived types, FortWrap uses an object handle approach,
    where a pointer to the derived type is stored and passed to
    arguments that operate on that derived type.  Thus the derived
    type can not be directly inspected from C++, but the object handle
    (pointer) can be passed to Fortran routines that operate on
    it.</p>

  <p>FortWrap scans the Fortran source code for definitions of derived
    types and Fortran subroutines that operate on those derived types.
    For each derived type it finds, it creates a corresponding C++
    class.  After parsing the Fortran source code, C++ methods are
    then created by associating Fortran subroutines with derived
    types.  The rule for this association process is
    simple: <span class="hl">each Fortran subroutine with a derived
    type as its first argument is translated into a method of the
    corresponding C++ class.</span></p>

  <p>FortWrap also provides special mechanisms for wrapping certain
    Fortran routines as C++ constructors and destructors.  If a
    Fortran routine can be classified as a method and contains the
    string "<tt>_ctor</tt>", it is translated into a C++ constructor
    for the corresponding class.  Multiple constructors are supported,
    provided the resulting C++ code will compile (i.e. the function
    signatures are different).  Similarly, if a Fortran routine
    contains the string "<tt>_dtor</tt>", it is treated as a
    destructor and automatically called from the C++ destructor.
    These types of methods are useful for derived types that make use
    of dynamically allocated memory.  The regular expressions used to
    identify constructors and destructors can be modified by using
    the <tt>%ctor</tt> and <tt>%dtor</tt> directives in the
    configuration file.</p>
    
  <h3><a name="details-class">CLASS and polymorphism (experimental)</a></h3>

  <p>FortWrap includes experimental support for wrapping CLASS data
  structures, which support type bound procedures, inheritance, and
  polymorphism.  The objective is to create a set of C++ classes and
  methods that mirror the structure of the original Fortran code; this
  includes inheritance and polymorphism.</p>

  <p>A key distinction is the use of "type bound procedures", which
  look like:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
TYPE Object
CONTAINS
  PROCEDURE :: foo => foo_def
END TYPE Object

...

SUBROUTINE foo_def(o)
  CLASS(Object) :: o
END SUBROUTINE foo_def
</pre></div>

  <p>Notice that the use of type bound procedures requires defining
  the procedure dummy arguments as <tt>CLASS</tt> instead
  of <tt>TYPE</tt>.  FortWrap will create a wrapper C++ class with
  methods for each type bound procedure, even when the actual
  procedures are declared private to the Fortran module (the use of
  type bound procedures in this way allows one to reduce name
  pollution in large Fortran projects).</p>

  <p>As with basic derived type wrapping, FortWrap identifies
  constructor and destructor procedures based on pattern matching with
  the string "<tt>__ctor</tt>" (see <a href="#details-dt">Derived
  Types</a>).  The latest Fortran standards allow creating more
  natural constructors by writing a procedure that returns a derived
  type and using an interface statement to assign that procedure to
  the same name as the derived type.  This can also facilitate dynamic
  instantiation of inherited types by using the constructor with
  the <tt>SOURCE</tt> attribute inside the <tt>ALLOCATE</tt>
  statement.  Currently, FortWrap cannot wrap procedures that return
  derived types, but the workaround is to write a wrapper procedure
  that is a subroutine, which calls the constructor function.  See the
  examples in <tt>tests/classes</tt> of the FortWrap installation.</p>


  <h3><a name="details-opt">Optional Arguments</a></h3>

  <p>Fortran 90 provides for optional procedure arguments that may be
    passed by position or keyword from Fortran.  Although
    interoperating with optional arguments is not explicitly provided
    for by the Fortran standard, FortWrap takes advantage of the fact
    that both the g95 and gfortran compilers implement optional
    arguments in a simple manner that is easy to mimic from C code.
    Specifically, these compilers use null pointers to indicate
    optional arguments that are not present.</p>

  <p>FortWrap exploits this by allowing the arguments to be optional
    from C++.  The usage is not quite as friendly as it would be from
    Fortran, though, since C++ does not support keyword arguments.
    However, FortWrap tries to make the usage as simple as possible by
    automatically giving all optional arguments default values
    of <tt>NULL</tt>.  Note also that one consequence of using
    optional arguments is that they may not be passed by value from
    C++.  Normally FortWrap will wrap primitive scalar types
    with <tt>INTENT(IN)</tt> as pass-by-value arguments from C++, but
    FortWrap must resort to pass-by-reference for optional arguments
    (however, see the<a href="#Swig">Swig notes</a>; if re-wrapping
    with Swig, this is not an issue).</p>

  <p>Consider the following Fortran subroutine:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(o,a,b,c,d)
  TYPE(Object) :: o
  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: a
  INTEGER, INTENT(IN), OPTIONAL :: b, c
  INTEGER, INTENT(OUT), OPTIONAL :: d
  ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre></div>  

  <p>Given that an instance <tt>o</tt> as well
    as <tt>int</tt>'s <tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, <tt>c</tt>,
    and <tt>d</tt> have been declared, the following are examples of
    valid C++ calls:</p>

<div class="targetlang"><pre>
o.foo(a);
o.foo(a,&b);
o.foo(a,NULL,&c);
o.foo(a,&b,&c,&d);
o.foo(a,NULL,NULL,&d);
</pre></div>

  <p>Note that <tt>a</tt> is passed by value, whereas the optional
    arguments must be passed by reference.  Also note that it makes
    sense to define the most used optional arguments at the start of the
    argument list, because the optional arguments must be passed by
    position, and intermediate optional arguments not being provided
    must be passed <tt>NULL</tt>.</p>
    
  <h3><a name="details-orphans">Non-method procedures</a></h3>

  <p>FortWrap can wrap procedures that do not operate on a derived
    type.  In keeping with the object-oriented slant (and also to
    reduce namespace pollution), such procedures are by default
    wrapped as static methods of a dummy class
    named <tt>FortFuncs</tt>.  The name of this class can be changed
    using the <tt>--dummy-class</tt> option.</p>

  <p>As an alternative, the <tt>--global</tt> option can be used to
    wrap non-method procedures as global functions defined in
    the <tt>FortFuncs.h</tt> header file.</p>

  <p>Default wrapping of these procedures can also be disabled by
    using <tt>--no-orphans</tt>.  It is still possible to include
    specific non-method procedures in the interfaces by
    using <tt>%include</tt> directives.</p>
    

  <h3><a name="details-arrays">Arrays</a></h3>

  <p>By default, one-dimensional arrays are wrapped
    to <tt>std::vector&lt;&gt;*</tt>, with a <tt>const</tt> qualifier
    for <tt>INTENT(IN)</tt> arguments.  FortWrap will detect arguments
    that are used to define the Fortran array size; these are hidden
    from the generated interface and are calculated automatically
    based on the size of the vector container that is passed in.</p>
  
  <p>The option <tt>--no-vector</tt> can be used to create C-style
    arrays, although with this option FortWrap can not hide the array
    size arguments from the generated interface.</p>

  <p>FortWrap does not currently support assumed shape
    (e.g. <tt>X(:)</tt>) array arguments.  However, these cases can be
    handled by writing a Fortran wrapper that FortWrap can wrap.  For
    example, in order to handle a subroutine like:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
SUBROUTINE bad_sub(x)
  INTEGER :: x(:)
  ...
END SUBROUTINE bad_sub
</pre></div>

  <p>write a Fortran wrapper that calls the original routine:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
SUBROUTINE bad_sub_wrap(n,x)
  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n
  INTEGER :: x(n)
  CALL bad_sub(x)
END SUBROUTINE bad_sub_wrap
</pre></div>

  <p>There is the possibility of a future version of FortWrap creating
    these types of wrappers automatically.</p>

  <h3><a name="details-matrices">Matrices</a></h3>

  <p>By default, matrices are wrapped using a special template
    class <tt>FortranMatrix</tt>.  The header
    file <tt>FortranMatrix.h</tt> is created when needed.  Part of its
    purpose is to hide the fact that C and Fortran store
    multi-dimensional array data in different orders.  Element access
    is provided via the overloaded parentheses operator.  Note that
    although the base Fortran index is 1 (by default), the base index
    used by the <tt>FortranMatrix</tt> class is 0.  Bounds checking is
    done via a C assertion, but this can be tweaked or commented-out
    as needed.</p>

  <p>As an example usage, consider declaring an integer matrix with 4
    rows and 2 columns, and setting the value of the 1st row and 2nd
    column:</p>

<div class="targetlang"><pre>
FortranMatrix&lt;int&gt; X(4,2);
X(0,1) = 10;
</pre></div>

  <p>The <tt>--no-fmat</tt> option can be used to prevent use of
    the <tt>FortranMatrix</tt> wrapper class, in which case
    two-dimensional arrays are wrapped as pointers.</p>



  <h3><a name="details-procpointers">Procedure Pointers</a></h3>

  <p>The Fortran 2003 standard provides support for procedure pointers
    as well as mechanisms for interoperating with procedure pointers
    from C.  Procedure pointer arguments are wrapped by FortWrap with
    the limitation that the interface must be explicit and defined via
    an <tt>ABSTRACT INTERFACE</tt> block.
    See <tt>tests/function_pointers</tt> for example usage.</p>

  <p>FortWrap will parse the abstract interface definition to generate
    the corresponding C function pointer prototype.  Make sure that the
    callback target conforms to this prototype.</p>


  <h3><a name="details-strings">Strings</a></h3>

  <p>FortWrap provides powerful support for processing strings.  This
    is a difficult language feature to handle well, and the Fortran
    standard for string interoperability is no help.</p>

  <p>FortWrap can wrap any scalar string arguments that are
    either <tt>INTENT(IN)</tt> or <tt>INTENT(OUT)</tt>.  The string
    length may be assumed (<tt>len=*</tt>), a literal constant, or a
    named constant from an <tt>INTEGER, PARAMETER</tt> declaration
    that FortWrap has already parsed.</p>

  <p>Strings that are <tt>INTENT(IN)</tt> are wrapped as <tt>const
    char*</tt>: this allows for string literals to be passed directly
    from the C code (see the examples in the <tt>tests</tt>
    directory).  Strings that are <tt>INTENT(OUT)</tt> are wrapped as
    C++ <tt>std::string</tt>.  In all cases, the wrapper code declares
    a statically allocated temporary character array, which is passed
    to Fortran.  Conversion between the C null terminator and
    Fortran's trailing whitespace, as well as passing the hidden
    string length argument, are all handled automatically.</p>

  <p>Note that when wrapping a character argument that has assumed
    length and is <tt>INTENT(OUT)</tt>, FortWrap will determine the
    size of the temporary array to be allocated based on the size of
    the <tt>std::string</tt> input.  Thus, consider
    using <tt>std::string::resize</tt>; otherwise, if an unitialized
    string of size 0 is passed from C++, the Fortran code will receive
    a character dummy argument with length 0.</p>

  <h3><a name="details-comments">Doxygen Comments</a></h3>

  <p>FortWrap automatically transfers Fortran doxygen comments into
    C++ doxygen comments in the generated header files.  This way the
    C++ header files can be processed by doxygen to generate C++ API
    documentation.</p>

  <p>Comments that are transferred may be attached to derived types,
    procedures, and arguments.  FortWrap also adds intent in/out
    specifiers and ARRAY flags to the C++ doxygen comments for
    arguments.  The example in <tt>tests/comments</tt> is provided to
    illustrate the format for using doxygen comments in the Fortran
    source code.</p>


  <h2><a name="Files">Generated Files</a></h2>

<h3><pre>FortWrap.h</pre></h3>

<p>This is a catch-all include file for all of the C++ wrapper code.
Your C++ program only needs to include this.</p>

<h3><pre>CppWrappers.f90</pre></h3>

<p>This source file is generated when either derived types or
  procedure pointers are wrapped.  For each derived type that is being
  wrapped, corresponding "allocate" and "deallocate" wrapper functions
  are generated for creating C "handles" to the Fortran derived type.
  When applicable, this source file will also define a small
  procedure pointer conversion routine.</p>

<h3>Class Wrappers</h3>

<p>For each Fortran derived type being wrapped, a corresponding C++
  class is created.  Two C++ files are created: a header file defining
  the class and a source code file defining the methods.  The header
  file is the place to look to find out how to call the methods that
  FortWrap has generated.</p>

<h3>Dummy Class or Global Wrappers</h3>

  <p>When you wrap procedures that do not operate on a derived type,
    FortWrap wraps them as static members of a dummy C++ class
    called <tt>FortFuncs</tt>.  FortWrap will generate two files to
    define this class: <tt>FortFuncs.h</tt>
    and <tt>FortFuncs.cpp</tt>.  Note that the name of this class and
    its associated files can be changed with
    the <tt>--dummy-class</tt> option.</p>

  <p>When using the <tt>--global</tt> option, the same files are
    created, but the non-method procedures are wrapped as global
    functions.  The <tt>--dummy-class</tt> option also functions to
    change the associated filenames in this case.</p>

<h3><pre>FortranMatrix.h</pre></h3>

<p> This is the definition of the <tt>FortranMatrix</tt> template
  class that is provided for working with matrix arguments.  This file
  is only generated when matrix arguments are wrapped.</p>

<h3><pre>InterfaceDefs.h</pre></h3>

<p>A small header file for FortWrap to declare a few things.</p>
