FortWrap 2.0 summary:
- Experimental support for Fortran object oriented features:
  - Wrapping of type bound procedures
  - Fortran type extension translated into C++ classes with
    inheritance structure
  - Support for abstract types and deferred procedures (translated
    into pure virtual methods in C++)
- Minor fixes:
  - Fix to prevent argument clash when wrapping procedures that
    contain other procedure definitions with the same argument names
  - Fix to not use case-sensitivity when matching names in the
    argument list to their type declarations

FortWrap 1.0.5 summary:
- Added option --no-std-string, which uses a wrapper class to manage
  character output argument conversions, instead of std::string.  This
  can eliminate C++ library conflicts in some cases.
- Fix for renaming of derived types with the interface file
- Fix to make derived type name matching case insensitive
- Proper exclusion of ALLOCATABLE and POINTER arguments from wrapper
  code

FortWrap 1.0.4 summary:
- Fixing bug for optional assumed length strings

FortWrap 1.0.3 summary:
- Added support for assumed length strings (intent(in) and
  intent(out))

FortWrap 1.0.2 summary:
- Added support for INTEGER(8)
- Added option to specify name of constants class

FortWrap 1.0.1 summary:
- Added support for enumerations

FortWrap 1.0 summary:
- Added option to disable wrapping non-method procedures
- Added option to suppress warnings for procedures not wrapped

- Added support for C_INT, C_FLOAT, and C_DOUBLE KIND spec's
- Added support for use of named PARAMETER in KIND spec
- Added capability to customize regular expressions used for
  identifying constructors and destructors
- Better handling of ABSTRACT INTERFACE
- Better handling of comments

- Fix for return codes

FortWrap 0.9.15 summary:
- Added support for higher dimensional (>2) arrays
- Added option to turn off use of FortranMatrix wrapper class
- Changed --c-arrays option to --no-vector

FortWrap 0.9.14 summary:
- Fixes for parsing lower case type definitions, such as 'real'

FortWrap 0.9.13 summary:
- Changed default compiler from g95 to gfortran

FortWrap 0.9.12 summary:
- Added support for integer kinds 1,2,4
- Added support for character length specification via '*':
  CHARACTER*20
- Improved robustness for processing Fortran integer parameter
  declarations, which might be used in string length definitions

FortWrap 0.9.11 summary:
- Added capability to wrap non-module (top-level) procedures
- Added exception handler to gracefully handle FortWrap internal
  errors
- Improved error and warning messages
- Fixes to handle data statements with * and KIND; however, wrapper
  generation is currently only supported for REAL*8, REAL(KIND=4), and
  REAL(KIND=8)
- Fixed bug parsing assumed shape arrays
- Added support for DOUBLE PRECISION statement
- Added error handling for COMPLEX types (which are not supported)

FortWrap 0.9.10 summary:
- Fixed bug parsing functions with array return values
- Fixed bug handling DIMENSION when it is followed by INTENT

FortWrap 0.9.9 summary:
- Added support for string arguments that are optional
- Changed interface for intent(in) strings to use character arrays,
  which makes it easier to pass string literals
- Fixed bug using intent(out) strings with functions
- Made run_tests.py script more portable: should now work on Windows
  under msys and cygwin (and possibly cmd.exe)

FortWrap 0.9.8 summary:
- Added a brief walkthrough to the manual
- Added support for intent(in) strings

FortWrap 0.9.7 summary:
- Fixed issues parsing high-dimensional arrays and certain
  declarations with DIMENSION
- Fix for makefile (had CPPFLAGS and CXXFLAGS mixed up, and it was
  working with gcc 4.1 but not with 4.6)
- Tweaks to function_pointer and array tests for improved
  compatibility
- Correction to manual: FortWrap actually does support assumed size
  arrays

FortWrap 0.9.6 summary:
- Added support for a configuration file (-i command option), which
  allows more control over the wrapping process (renaming or ignoring
  objects/procedures, etc.)
- More additions to documentation

- Fixed bug for processing compiler specification with -c

FortWrap 0.9.4 summary:

  functions instead of static members of dummy class

  to wrap non-method procedures
- Improved error checking for invalid source files
- Exit without generating any files if there is nothing to wrap

FortWrap 0.9.3 summary:
- Added option --c-arrays to generate C-style array wrappers instead
  of C++ vector containers

FortWrap 0.9.2 summary: 
- Added proper handling for top-level procedures (print warning) and
  multi-module files
- Expanded documentation

FortWrap 0.9.1 summary: 
- Added support for lowercase Fortran keywords

FortWrap 0.9 summary: 
- Initial release
